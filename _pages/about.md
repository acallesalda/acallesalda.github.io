I am a second year PhD. student in statistics at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://stat.wisc.edu). My interests are Gaussian processes, probabilistic forecasting and Bayesian inference. I am currently working in the [Katzfuss group](https://sites.google.com/view/katzfuss/group) 

I completed a BSc. and a MSc. at Universidad EAFIT and worked some years as a Data Scientist before starting my PhD. Outside of math/statistics, I quite enjoy reading (see my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5880518-alejandro-calle-saldarriaga)).
