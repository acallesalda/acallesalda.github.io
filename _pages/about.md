I am a Mathematical Engineer (BSc.) and Applied Mathematician (MSc.) from Universidad EAFIT. My interest are functional data analysis, non-parametric statistics, robust statistics, statistical learning, computational logic, and optimization. Outside of math/statistics, I quite enjoy reading (see my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5880518-alejandro-calle-saldarriaga)). Right now I work as a lecturer at Universidad EAFIT (functional data analysis, statistics) and as a data (lead, generalist?) at [somos](https://www.somosinternet.co/).
