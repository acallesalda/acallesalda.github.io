Abstract: Automatic theorem provers need to recieve a reasonably small number of premises in order for them to be able to prove a given conjecture with limited processor time. In large theories this is not always possible, as many irrelevant clauses are added to the premises. In order to solve this problem, premise selection algorithms have emerged in the past few years, some using non-learning methods and others using learning ones. Our goal in this project is to implement a non-learning premise selection algorithm for Apia, in order to further link the interactive theorem prover Agda with Authomatic theorem provers.
