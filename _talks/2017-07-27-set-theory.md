Abstract: Set theory has been is one of the most important fields for the foundations of mathematics, so having a formalization (i.e. a translation of its axiom and theorems into some proof assistant) is desirable. In this talk, we present a set theory formalization of the Z axioms and some theorems using Agda. [Slides](https://acallesalda.github.io/files/set-theory-acs.pdf)
